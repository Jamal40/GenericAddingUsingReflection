# GenericAddingUsingReflection

## have made this idea to practice Reflection.

## Inspiration
Drupal inspired me to achieve this idea. I liked how Drupal handles adding/posting different contents using only one endpoint. 
So I wanted to put my reflection knowledge into a test and made it.

## Performance
Maybe this approach is not the most performant way to achieve this. Raw Sql & ADO.Net is definitely much faster than using Reflection & EfCore.
But Reflection and EF is much more fun to me.
